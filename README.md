# phaser-golf

My original intent was to learn and explore [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), which is a Javscript based game engine for creating 2D games.
So, I decided to create a digital version of [Paper Appsâ„¢ GOLF](https://gladdendesign.com/products/paper-apps-golf).

> You must navigate a course to get your ball to the hole in as few strokes as possible. Your path can go over water, but the ball can't land in it. Hitting from the fairway gives you a boost, while hitting from sand shortens your distance.
